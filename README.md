# Task Scheduler Windows App

The Task Scheduler is a built-in Windows utility that enables scheduling programs or scripts to run at specific times. It is widely used for tasks like automated software updates and backups.

However, during a live performance or other critical operations, you don’t want scheduled tasks, such as software updates or backups, consuming CPU, RAM, or storage. This could result in latency, audio glitches, or other performance issues.

## Accessing Task Scheduler

To open the Task Scheduler:
1. Click the `Start` button, type "task scheduler", and select the `Task Scheduler`.
2. Navigate to **Task Scheduler Library** to view scheduled tasks.

Many of these tasks, like the Dropbox Update Task, are often set to run late at night, which could coincide with your performance. We recommend disabling or rescheduling tasks to ensure no background processes disrupt your work.

- Right-click each task and choose `Disable` to temporarily stop it.
- Double-click a task to modify its triggers, actions, and schedule.

## Reviewing and Managing Tasks

Opening the **Task Scheduler Library** is just the beginning. Expand the library folders to find additional tasks that may require review.

1. **Initial Review:**

    - Avoid letting tasks queue up to run when you turn on your computer. If a task hasn’t executed as scheduled, untick the option to "Run the task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed."
    
2. **Categorize and Take Action:**

    - **Delete Irrelevant Tasks:** If you're certain some tasks are unnecessary (e.g., Xbox-related tasks for non-Xbox users or Customer Experience Improvement Program tasks that send data to Microsoft), delete them.
    - **Disable Temporary Tasks:** For tasks you might need later, like Bluetooth or Disk Cleanup, disable them instead of deleting. You can run Disk Cleanup manually when needed.
    - **Reschedule Critical Tasks:** Adjust tasks such as System Restore or Windows Backup to run outside your performance or work hours.
